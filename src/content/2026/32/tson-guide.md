# TSON Developer Guide

**Status:** Non-normative companion to the TSON specification series, 2026 revision series. This guide collects the design history, rationale, and extended worked examples that the specifications reference but do not carry. Nothing here is normative; where this guide appears to disagree with [TSON-DATA] or [TSON-SCHEMA], the specifications govern.


## 1. What TSON Is

TSON is a schema system with its own notation. At its centre is a type system ([TSON-SCHEMA]): immutable, hash-pinned schemas whose definitions are themselves data, resolving down a verified chain — document → schema → meta-schema → kernel — so that one hash authenticates a document together with its entire contract. The TSON text format ([TSON-DATA]) is that system's notation and its reference encoding: a Unicode-first superset of JSON, pleasant enough to use on its own, typed even without a schema. Schemas are the point; the text format is how they are written down — and the first of the encodings that carry them.

If you arrived here thinking "another JSON dialect", that is a reasonable first impression and a wrong one. The unquoted names and optional commas are real, and they matter for daily use — but they are the notation's manners, not the system's identity. The nearest relatives are not JSON5 or JSONC but Avro and ASN.1: systems where the schema is the product and wire formats serve it. TSON takes that architecture and adds three things those systems never had together: schemas that are ordinary, hash-verifiable documents in the same notation as the data; a schemaless mode that is still typed; and an extension model where new type vocabularies arrive as data, never as grammar changes.

### 1.1 The chain, walked once

Everything in TSON hangs off one picture. Here is a data document:

```
!!schema:"https://example.com/people.tn1?sha256=c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5"
!person { name: "Ada Lovelace"  born: 1815-12-10 }
```

The `!!schema` directive names the contract, pinned by content hash. `!person` names which of the schema's types this value instantiates. Note what `born` looks like: an unquoted token, no annotation. The schema declares the field as a `date`, so the date atom parses it — the data stays clean because the contract carries the types.

The schema it names is itself a TSON document:

```
!!id:"https://example.com/people.tn1"
!!meta:"https://tson.io/2026/32/m/meta.tn1"
!!import:"https://tson.io/2026/32/m/core.tn1"
{
  person => { name: text  born: date }
}
```

Same lexer, same tokens, same tooling — a second body grammar behind the same header. And the schema stands on the same relation it offers: its `!!meta` names the meta-schema that validates *its* declarations, and its `!!import` brings in the core type library that defines `text` and `date`. The meta-schema chains to the meta-kernel; the kernel's `!!meta` names itself, and the circle is closed not by resolution but by pre-loading — implementations ship the kernel's resolved structure, and the kernel document is the TSON encoding of it. The in-memory model is authoritative; the file describes it.

Every rung is immutable and hash-pinnable, and hashes attach to canonical identities rather than URLs, so a consumer holding one hashed reference can verify a document together with its schema, that schema's meta-schema, and the kernel — the entire contract, authenticated from a single identifier, with no network access required or trusted (§3.3–§3.4 below detail the identity and verification discipline). Schema URLs are names resolved through a local library; fetching is an opt-in way to populate it, never the meaning of a reference.

That is the product. Everything else in the series — the grammar, the resolver, the encoding rules — exists to make that picture true.

### 1.2 Immutable means versioned

The schema in §1.1 will never change. Not *should not* — cannot: a schema's identity is its exact byte content ([TSON-SCHEMA] §3.5), and the hash in the data document's `!!schema` pins those bytes. Editing `people.tn1` does not update the schema; it creates a different document that no existing reference names.

So when the contract needs to grow, you publish:

```
!!id:"https://example.com/people-v2.tn1"
!!meta:"https://tson.io/2026/32/m/meta.tn1"
!!import:"https://tson.io/2026/32/m/core.tn1"
{
  person => { name: text  born: date  email: text }
}
```

Look at what just happened: `email` is **required**. In every mutable-schema system, that is the forbidden edit — protobuf marks `required` *"Do not use"* because a required field added to a shared definition breaks every document already written; Avro demands a default; GraphQL says deprecate, never remove or tighten. Every one of those rules exists because a single definition must serve every document ever written against it. Here it doesn't have to: the §1.1 document names `people.tn1` by hash and validates against it forever, untouched by v2's existence; new documents name `people-v2.tn1`. Two contracts coexist, each at full strength. Neither is "the" schema — *the* schema is not a concept in this system; a *document's* schema is. (The `-v2` in the name is a convention for humans; the system's notion of version is identity plus hash, and nothing parses the suffix.)

Once that lands, the ripples reach nearly everything:

- **Required means required.** No leaving fields optional for future-proofing, no reserved field numbers, no tombstone fields carried forever. Records are closed under their type ([TSON-SCHEMA] §7.2): a v2 document without `email` is invalid, and a v1 document is never asked for one.
- **Unknown fields need no tolerating.** The "must ignore unknown fields" robustness rule exists to survive in-place evolution; with no in-place evolution, closure is safe — and a typo in a field name becomes an error instead of silently discarded data.
- **Acceptance is explicit.** A reader declares which versions it accepts by registering exactly those schemas in its library — and because the version key sits on the document's opening lines, readable before any value parsing, a front door can route v1 and v2 traffic to different servers without opening the body.
- **Migration is a function between two known values.** Both schemas are data (§1.3), so "what changed between v1 and v2" is a structural diff a tool can compute, and a v1→v2 transform has a precise input contract and a precise output contract.

Every design choice in §1.1 was quietly serving this moment: hashes attach to canonical identities so a pin survives mirroring; the id line is excluded from its own hash so a document can carry its name; the header classifies in two directives so routers never parse bodies. The full versioning story — including why routing by schema beats binding one server to every version, and the compatibility-rulebook history this model retires — is §9.1.

### 1.3 Schemas are data

A schema document *resolves* to a value: a map from type names to `type_definition` records, every one of them expressible in ordinary TSON. The `person` declaration above resolves to:

```
person => !type_definition {
  kind: PRODUCT
  body: !record { fields: [
    !record_field { name: name  type: text }
    !record_field { name: born  type: date }
  ] }
}
```

This reflexivity is load-bearing, not decorative. It means resolver output can be serialized, diffed, and shipped as fixtures; it means the meta layer can describe itself; and it means the system grows by publishing new schema documents — new type libraries, extended meta-schemas — rather than by amending a grammar. The kernel and the grammar are frozen at version 1; the meta layer is the sanctioned extension point, and extensions travel as data down the same verified chain as everything else.

It also dissolves the old bootstrap riddle. "What validates the meta-kernel?" has a concrete answer here: the pre-loaded meta-kernel, which exists as implementation structure before any document is parsed. The self-reference in the kernel's header is a description of that fact, not a dependency to resolve.

The research behind the design calls this discipline the **proto-schema** (§2): every schema in the system, walked down its chain, flattens to the meta-kernel — a handful of kinds, a few constructors, and one record, `type_definition`, that describes every type in existence including itself. The closest ancestor in spirit is Lisp. Where Lisp reduced computation to its purest form — programs written in the language's own data structures, an evaluator expressible in the language it evaluates — the proto-schema attempts the same reduction for description: data described by data, all the way down to a kernel that describes itself. Homoiconicity, for contracts rather than code.

### 1.4 Typed without a schema

Most schema systems make you choose: protobuf will not run without an IDL; JSON Schema leaves untouched data untyped. TSON is gradually typed. With no schema in scope, base type resolution gives you JSON's value model plus real numbers — hex, binary, digit separators, arbitrary precision — and the built-in type vocabulary gives you common typed values by annotation alone:

```
{
  id:     !uuid 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
  price:  !number 19.99
  placed: !datetime "2026-07-18T09:30:00Z"
  digest: !hex 4f2a90de11c3b7a6
}
```

Each annotation invokes a parsing contract — the value becomes a UUID, an exact decimal, a datetime, bytes — with no schema anywhere. And because every valid JSON document (outside two character-level exceptions) is already valid TSON, the adoption path runs from "paste your JSON in" through "annotate the values that matter" to "bind a schema and pin it by hash", each step optional and each step reversible. The schemaless built-ins and the core type library denote the same contracts, so annotations added on day one mean the same thing under the schema bound on day ninety.

### 1.5 One model, many encodings

The type system stands above any particular wire form. Inside the specification this shows up as a discipline: a token's quoting is lexical necessity, never meaning (`!number 10.2` and `!number "10.2"` are the same value); a set is a schema property carried in array syntax, because "unordered" is an instruction to the reader, not a property of linear data; whether a `!variant` tag may be omitted rests on a disjointness fact the resolver derives independently of any encoding, with each encoding stating its own discrimination rule over it.

Part 2's §7 — the Text Encoding Rules — is the first instance of the pattern: how the type system's values are carried in TSON text. Other encodings state their own rules against the same model. A JSON encoding must decide what a tuple, a typed map key, or the absent sentinel become in a poorer notation; those decisions are parameters, and because schemas are data, the parameters themselves can travel as schema-governed documents beside the schemas they configure. The type system decides *what the value is*; an encoding decides *how it is spelled*.

### 1.6 Reading the series

The series is two documents and six artifacts:

- **[TSON-DATA] — Part 1: Text Data Format** — stands alone: the lexer (frozen, shared by the whole series), the data grammar, base type resolution, and the built-in type vocabulary. If you are writing a parser, an editor mode, or a formatter, it is the whole job — start here and stay here until it passes the data-format test suite. A Class 1 processor needs nothing from Part 2 and remains a complete, useful tool: a better JSON, with types.
- **[TSON-SCHEMA] — Part 2: Type System and Schema** — the centre of the series: a second body grammar over the same lexer, the type system, the schema chain, and resolver output. If you are writing a validator or resolver, this is your contract. Read §3 (the schema chain) first — it is the picture above, made normative — then §4–§5 for the type system and its grammar, §8 for what resolution produces, and §7 for how typed values are carried in text.
- The **companion artifacts** — `meta-kernel.tn1`, `meta.tn1`, `core.tn1` and their resolved fixtures — are the normative vocabulary and the reference answers: the system describing itself. Implementations pre-load the kernel and meta as in-memory structures; the documents are *descriptions* of those structures, and round-tripping them is the first serious integration test. Reading the kernel after Part 2 §4 is the fastest way to make the type system concrete.

A useful reading order for implementers: Part 1 §7 (the lexer and grammars), Part 1 §2–§4 (documents and base resolution), Part 2 §3 (the schema chain), Part 2 §5 (the type-definition grammar), Part 2 §8 (resolver output), then the fixtures. This guide carries what the specifications exclude on principle — rationale, design history, worked examples, deployment guidance — and nothing in it is normative.


## 2. Design History

TSON's schema model was derived rather than assembled from precedent. The proto-schema research series (tson.io/research/proto-schema/) starts from the physical constraints of serialized data — linear, immutable, finite, divisible — and derives what a schema can be: Sequence and Choice as the structural primitives; Tuple, Record, Array, Map, and Set as the configurations of Sequence worth naming; templates as definitions with blanks on a spectrum of completeness; composition with narrowing rules that preserve substitutability; required-by-default multiplicity with absence as a sentinel rather than a type. The kernel is that conclusion made executable — its constructors and constraint vocabularies match the research's tables field for field. The sections below record the individual decisions the specifications state without argument, including the places where the final design overruled the research's first conclusions, and why.

### 2.1 No comments

TSON has no comment syntax. This is not an oversight inherited from JSON but a decision re-made deliberately: comments are metadata, and TSON already has a metadata channel with defined semantics — annotations. A comment is invisible to the data model, gets lost on round-trip unless implementations invent preservation rules, and inevitably becomes a side-channel for machine-readable content (as happened with JSON parsers that accept `//` and the ecosystem of magic comments in YAML). `@doc:"..."` does everything a comment does, survives round-trips by rule, is attached to a specific value rather than a lexical position, and is typed and validatable when a schema is in scope. The cost — you cannot annotate *nothing*, or comment out a region — is accepted: TSON documents are interchange artifacts, not source code.

### 2.2 No anchors, references, or merge operators

The locality principle ([TSON-DATA] §1.2 principle 6) says a value is fully local: what appears at a position is the complete value. YAML's anchors and merge keys are the counter-model, and their costs are well documented — reference cycles (the "billion laughs" family), non-local reasoning (you cannot review a value without scrolling to its anchor), and merge semantics that differ across implementations. TSON's position is that reuse belongs to the producing application, not the wire format. Where genuine cross-document reference is needed, it is explicit and typed: a `!uri` value plus an application-level dereference policy, or the schema layer's `extern`.

### 2.3 The `!!include` deletion

Earlier drafts defined a fifth directive operation, external inclusion (`!!include`), which spliced the contents of another document into the current one at parse time. It was deleted, for three reinforcing reasons. First, it violated locality in the worst way: the meaning of a document depended on I/O performed mid-parse, so no document could be classified, hashed, or reviewed from its own bytes. Second, it created a security surface that the rest of the format had carefully avoided — parse-time fetching is exactly what §9.3/§11.2 of the specifications forbid by default. Third, it was redundant: inclusion decomposes into a reference (`!uri`) plus an application-level dereference policy, and applications that want transclusion can implement it above the format with full knowledge of their trust model. The deletion left the directive set closed at four names, which in turn allowed the grammar to enforce directive placement and cardinality structurally — no directive registry, no unknown-directive category, and document-kind classification from at most two directives of lookahead.

### 2.4 The braces restoration

A schema document's body is a braced map. An earlier revision deleted the enclosing braces on the grounds that they did no work — the declarations could simply run to end-of-file. Restoring them was deliberate, and the reason is annotation binding: TSON's one binding convention is that annotations precede the value they bind to, and without a body value there is no boundary between the document's annotations and the first declaration's. `@doc:"..." { ... }` binds to the schema by exactly the same rule that binds a data document's root annotations to its root value. The braces also make the semantics visible in the syntax: a schema *is* a map (`map<type_name, type_definition>`), and the symmetry between source and output is exact — source `@doc:"..." { name => type-def }` compiles to output `@doc:"..." !schema { name => !type_definition { ... } }`: the same shape, one rung down the ladder.

### 2.5 Subtraction breaks IS-A on purpose

Subtraction (`account - { password }` — a removal clause on a construction head) is the operation type systems usually refuse to provide, because removing a field from a subtype violates substitutability. TSON provides it *and* makes it break IS-A, which dissolves the objection: `account_public` is not claiming to be usable where `account` is expected — the resolver records an empty `type_definition.supertypes` precisely so no consumer can treat it as one. What survives is authorial lineage: the body's `record.supertypes` still says "this was derived from `account`", which is documentation, not contract. The two-supertypes split (contract vs lineage) is the general resolution of a real tension: readers of a schema want to know both *what a type promises* and *where it came from*, and conflating the two is how most schema languages end up with either no subtraction or unsound subtyping. The practical use cases — view types, redaction shapes, public projections of internal records — are common enough that forcing authors to re-declare near-duplicate records was judged the worse outcome.

### 2.6 Why elided modifiers are safer than they look

In a refinement body, `field: = value` (no type-ref) inherits the field's type and changes only its state. Allowing this looks like a convenience with a trap — what if the author typos the field name? — but the grammar closes the trap: a modifier-only entry names no type, so it *cannot* declare a new field, and an unmatched name is a resolver error rather than a silent addition. Compare the alternative, requiring the type to be restated: now a refinement that tightens `spec: uri` to a fixed value must repeat `uri`, and if the source declaration later changes the field's type, every downstream refinement silently pins the *old* type or errors at a distance. Elision makes the common tightening robust against upstream type changes; restating the type is reserved for the case where the tightening genuinely narrows the type, which is exactly when the author should be explicit.

### 2.7 Field groups: the XOR that prose was policing

Before field groups ([TSON-SCHEMA] §5.11), four constraint vocabularies — `integer_type`, `float_type`, `decimal_type`, `rational_type` — declared their bounds as four independently optional fields and stated in a doc string that "an inclusive and an exclusive bound on the same side is a schema error." The record shape happily admitted `{ min: 0 exclusive_min: 0 }`; the rule lived out-of-band, in the same bucket as `min ≤ max`. But the two rules are different in kind. A lower bound is a labelled disjunction — inclusive *or* exclusive, one location, one occupant, discriminated by field name — which is a shape, and a schema language that can't state its own recurring shapes in shape is under-serving its meta layer. The group construct makes the illegal state unrepresentable and, in doing so, sorted every prose coherence rule in the numeric vocabularies into a three-way taxonomy: **exclusion among fields** becomes a group; **co-presence dependency** becomes a factored sub-record (`bits`/`signed` became `integer_size`, both fields REQUIRED inside one OPTIONAL field — the pairing is now structural); **value-level relations** (`min ≤ max`, bounds within the width-derived range) remain schema-load checks, because no shape can capture a relation between values. Only the third bucket legitimately stays prose, and after the change, only the third bucket does.

The resolver-output encoding was the contested decision. Groups *flatten*: members become ordinary OPTIONAL fields, contiguous in source order, and the grouping is recorded beside them in `record.groups`. Three alternatives were rejected. A per-field boolean flag cannot distinguish two groups in one record and cannot carry group state. Repeating the full group record inside each member field reintroduces — inside the construct built to eliminate prose coherence rules — a new incoherent-but-well-formed state (sibling members disagreeing about their shared group) that only prose could police. A group-name field on `record_field` touches the most widely instantiated record in the ecosystem to serve a rare construct, and still needs somewhere to put group state, since flattened members are uniformly OPTIONAL regardless of it. The `groups` list touches only the definitions that use it; every pre-existing resolved fixture remains byte-identical. The lookup-cost objection — validators must join fields to groups — dissolves at schema load: membership compiles into a per-record table in one local pass, per the same eager-resolution convention that governs constraint-value conversion. The general rule this crystallised: canonical output stores derived data only when derivation is *non-local* (`type_definition.subtypes`, the inverse of `supertypes` across a whole schema, earns its storage); anything locally derivable stays normalized and is compiled at load. The output form is canonical, not operational.

### 2.8 The labelled choice that dissolved

The variant-mechanism survey behind the design (the Part 7 research article) concluded that labelled and unlabelled sums encode genuinely different ideas — a label carries a domain role independent of the type, so `created`, `modified`, and `accessed` can all be timestamps and still be distinguishable — and that both belonged in the model. TSON ships one sum primitive, `choice`, which is the *unlabelled* form: variants must be distinct type names, and data carries a mandatory `!variant` tag. The labelled form was a candidate third construct, and it was rejected because field groups made it derivable: a record whose entire body is one REQUIRED group admits exactly one field, and `timestamps => { ( created: timestamp | modified: timestamp | accessed: timestamp ) }` *is* the labelled sum — named, referenceable, discriminated by label, encoding as the single-field record `{ modified: … }`. The wrapped and unwrapped encodings that ASN.1's JSON encoding rules distinguish with an `UNWRAPPED` modifier fall out as placement: a group among sibling fields is the unwrapped form, a group as a record's sole content is the wrapped form — same construct, two positions, no encoding modifier. Of the four corners of the label/tag grid, `choice` covers tagged-unlabelled (and, over one-line reference types like `created => timestamp`, tagged-labelled, since TSON's tag *is* a name); groups cover the labelled-embedded corner; the untagged-unlabelled corner — JSON Schema's `anyOf`, discrimination by trying every variant against the structure — is deliberately unoccupied, refused by the `!variant` requirement. One residue is kind classification: the labelled-sum pattern resolves to kind PRODUCT, and a product of one sum is isomorphic to the sum, so this is a lowering concern — a code generator that recognises the shape (one REQUIRED group, no other fields) can emit a native sealed variant rather than a struct of nullables. A second residue is a gain: `choice` cannot be refined, but records can, so a labelled sum in record clothing acquires a subtyping story — a refinement can pin or forbid variants — that a primitive sum would not have had.


### 2.9 Why `!` takes constructors only

An earlier draft wrote atom narrowing as `!integer { min: 0 }` — the same `!T { ... }` surface that data mode rejects as a category error ("the constraint vocabulary belongs to the constructor"). One string, two grammars, opposite meanings; and because `!` could target either a constructor or an instance, a reader needed the resolver's lookup order to know whether a declaration created IS-A — the `_type` suffix convention was carrying the semantics. The fix is one restriction and one operator: `!` takes constructors only, and `^` is refinement — `T ^ { ... }` for record and map types, `~C<P> ^ { ... }` at the meta rung, `!I ^ { values }` for atom instances. The prefix names the rung; `^` names the operation; IS-A creation is visible at the head of the declaration. The invariant "`!T x` describes a value shaped by `T`" now holds in schema source, data documents, and resolver output alike, and the instance-vs-constructor lookup branching dissolved into declared intent. The bare juxtaposition `T { ... }` went with it: `name {` is a parse error whose diagnostic suggests `^` or `&`, replacing the grammar's subtlest visual distinction (`T & { ... }` vs `T { ... }` — one ampersand between preserved and absent IS-A) with two explicit operators.

### 2.10 Why subtraction is a head-level clause

The same earlier draft expressed subtraction as `field: _` inside a composition or narrowing body, which had two problems. An `&` head could promise IS-A per parent while a `_` three lines down silently revoked it — the reader had to scan the body to learn whether the head told the truth. And the marker sat one character from its semantic opposite: `password: _` (remove the field, break the contract) versus `password: text? = _` (keep the field, forbid its value, preserve the contract). Taxonomically, subtraction is composition's sibling — a construction that computes a field set and disclaims the contract — not a refinement, so it moved to where constructions declare themselves: a trailing removal clause, `account - { password }`, `account & { ... } - { password  ssn }`. The break is now visible on the declaration line; empty subtraction became ungrammatical rather than merely prohibited; and `^` heads reject the clause outright — an operator that promises IS-A cannot host the operation that revokes it. The `-` character was available because the bare tokens `-`, `+`, and `.` were withdrawn at the same time (§2.11): as tokens they were the accidental single-character strings `"-"`, `"+"`, `"."`, and they let a schema declare `42` or `-` as a type name. `+` was considered for composition — an arithmetic `+`/`-` pair — and rejected: in type-theoretic usage `&` is intersection, which is exactly what composition means, while `+` is the sum type, the one reading TSON's own SUM kind makes maximally misleading; and the pair suggests inverse and commutative laws the semantics contradict.

### 2.11 Size-specs into the grammar

The array size-spec was originally a single unquoted token validated against a regex in prose — `1..100` lexed as one token because digits and `.` are profile characters, so no parser production could ever split it. The fix is one lexer rule: the unquoted scanner terminates before consecutive dots, and `..` is a compound token (the range token), making the size-spec ordinary grammar — bounds around `..`, each matched against `decimal-natural`, with the regex deleted. The `+` spelling went with it: `1..` says the same thing, and the then-textual synthetic identity (§8.1 recounts its replacement) had been paying for the duplicate with two entries for one type. What stayed behind is instructive: only the `N ≤ M` relation remains a value-level check — run at schema load for literal bounds and at template materialisation for parameter bounds, since an open bound has no value to relate — the taxonomy of §2.7 applied to sizes, shapes into grammar, value relations into checks. The data-format cost was accepted with eyes open: range-shaped content (`2026-01..2026-06`) now splits at the range token and must be quoted, which is the exclusion principle of §3.1 finally reaching ranges — their quoting rule is "always", never a scan.


### 2.12 Templates as call sites for type finishing

The 2026 Revision 32 redesign of type references began with a representation bug and ended with a unification. The bug: synthetic entry names carried source spelling, so aliases forked identity and template bodies put binders inside strings (§8.1 below). The fix — a recursive `type_ref` record with `type_argument` children — made references structural, and each subsequent decision fell out of pressing one principle: *store shape as shape*. Constructor applications became self-describing structure rather than entries; entry names became internal; `source` became the single structured-provenance channel while `supertypes`, `subtypes`, and `target` stayed name-level indexes — one question, one channel.

The unification arrived when value parameters joined: the type operations form a two-by-two of {types, values} × {bind now, bind at call site}, and the fourth quadrant — values bound at the call site — was already occupied privately by the array size sugar. `[order; 1..100]` *is* `array_ranged<order, 1, 100>`; the redesign made the templates real (`array_min`, `array_max`, `array_ranged`, kernel-declared without `~`) and routed the sugar through them, which also fixed an accident: sized arrays had been nominal siblings of `array`, and as refinement-template closures they are IS-A `array`, Liskov-clean. A template is a suspended declaration and application is the finishing step — which is why `~` is the discriminator that matters: with it, a refinement founds a new vocabulary head (`set` and `vector`, annotating their applications `!set` and `!vector`); without it, a refinement template's closures are ordinary members of the source family (`array_ranged` closures are `!array` bodies).

Two representational rules keep the machinery honest. The *shadowing/label rule*: parameters ride reference channels by shadowing (a token there is always a name) and value channels by label (`= P` routes and `~ P` defaults, `value_param` members) — on scalar fields because a bare token in a value channel is always a literal, so enum members never collide with parameter names, and on `type_ref`-typed type slots (§2.14) for uniformity, so substitution rewrites one channel — and `type_argument`'s two-member group makes the same split structural in argument lists, which is why it deliberately has no positional form. The *level rule*: open templates keep vocabulary-record bodies (the level where parameter channels exist), and binding records are closed-world — a body's own shape announces whether the definition is open, and it also decides refinability: `^` requires a vocabulary body, so a finished binding record (a construction, an instantiation, or an alias to one) is terminal, and narrower relatives are re-derived from the application head.

The theoretical basis is the **spectrum of completeness** developed in the proto-schema research series (Part 5, *Templates* — tson.io/research/proto-schema/part-5-templates/): data and schemas are one continuum distinguished by how many blanks remain, and a template is a pattern with blanks — a definition awaiting completion. The final design makes the spectrum mechanical and self-applied: `record_field` *is* the bead (name, type, state, and a value channel that is concrete, defaulted, pinned, blank-by-parameter, or absent), member population is the visible completeness coordinate (`value_param: N` → `value: 2`; `{ name: T }` → `{ name: status }`), the body's level — vocabulary or binding — is the other, and there is no separate template wrapper: an open and a closed definition are the same `type_definition` at different points on the spectrum. The research piece's open puzzle — the "odd syntax where the template value is separated from the length value" in its `float3`/`vector` sketch — is resolved by the unified signature (`vector<float, 3>`, one argument list, both kinds), and its instinct that partial types must stay "out of data formats and the values they represent" became the closed-world binding-record rule: data-mode values never contain parameter machinery. Two of its open questions were answered *no* for v1, deliberately: bounded blanks (`<T: string | fullName>`) are deferred — parameters are unannotated and kind-inferred — and the type-family reading of a bare template name (`[person]` as the choice over its instantiations) is absent: v1 requires full binding at every reference. Between them, the illegal states of the old model — a binder in a name, a parameter in a binding record, an ambiguous token — became unrepresentable rather than prohibited.

### 2.13 The pin-coherence relaxation

An earlier rule demanded that, within one resolution's reference closure, all references to a canonical identity agree in both directions: all hash-pinned with the same digest, or all plain. The rationale — "a dependency that is only sometimes verified is not verified" — sounded airtight and broke the moment it met publication. Three failures, each fatal on its own. **Viral pinning:** schemas are immutable, so a published schema carrying one plain reference to X permanently forbade every downstream closure containing it from ever pinning X — the strict rule turned a single author's omission into an ecosystem-wide, irrevocable prohibition, the exact inverse of what a verification rule should incentivise. **The kernel edge:** the kernel's self-referencing `!!meta` can never carry a hash, because the hash input is every byte after the `!!id` line and the `!!meta` line is among them — a pin there would have to hash bytes that already contain it. Under the strict rule, that one necessarily-plain edge collided with any pinned reference to the kernel from anywhere in a closure, making the meta layer categorically unpinnable. **The pre-load accident:** whether an imported schema's own plain references were even observed depended on whether the implementation had chosen to pre-load it — the same user schema loading on one conforming implementation and failing on another, forked by an optional optimisation.

The repair began by noticing that the rule's premise misdescribed the machinery it governed. Closure collection already deduplicates by canonical identity: however many references reach an identity, exactly one instance is loaded and every reference resolves to it. "Sometimes verified" was therefore never a state the system could occupy — there is one instance, verified once or not at all, serving all comers. Verification is a property of the *identity within the closure*, not of each reference, and the rule now says so: gather the set of declared digests across all references to each identity; an empty set resolves unverified (the development posture, unchanged); a single digest is verified against content once, at collection time and before any reference resolves, after which every reference — pinned and plain alike — resolves to the verified instance; two distinct digests remain a hard resolver error, since at most one can describe the real bytes. Leniency is not fallback: a plain reference inherits the strongest guarantee present in the closure, and inherits its failure — a mismatch poisons the identity for the whole resolution, and no reference proceeds with the rejected content merely because it declared no pin.

What the strict rule was reaching for — "I want to know my entire chain is verified" — survives, relocated to where it belongs: a deployment policy at the resolver boundary rather than a constraint the format imposes on every closure (§9.2). The relaxation is also what lets the published artifacts practise maximal pinning (§3.4): every pinnable edge in the kernel–meta–core chain ships pinned, while the one unpinnable edge — the kernel's self-reference — stays plain and grounded by pre-loading, without that plainness contaminating anything downstream.

### 2.14 Type slots ride the value channel

For months the kernel declared `array` with `element_type: T` — a field whose *type* was the parameter — and the mistake sat in plain sight because the surface reads so naturally. What exposed it was the kernel describing itself. The kernel's `schema` entry closes `map<type_name, type_definition>` to the body `!map { key_type: @alias:type_name token  value_type: type_definition }`, and validating that body against `map`'s vocabulary is impossible when `key_type`'s declared type is an unbound `K`: the fixture the specification names as its first serious integration test could not pass over the kernel that defines it. Every self-hosting system earns its keep this way — the self-description is not ceremony but the test that catches exactly this class of error, and it did.

The correction is a re-typing, not a redesign. An element type is not a value *of* type T; it is a *description of* a type — a reference — and its type never varies. Only its value does. So the slot is an ordinary field, `element_type: type_ref = T`, with the parameter riding the value channel like every other value-channel modifier. The rest of the kernel had been saying so all along: `record` carries its field types as `type_ref` *values* inside `record_field`, `tuple_element.element_type` is declared `type_ref`, `choice.variants` is `[type_ref]`. The parameterized constructors were the only places where a type description had been smuggled into a field's *type* position, and every downstream irritation traced to that one asymmetry — binding records no vocabulary could validate, bare parameterized heads annotating resolver output in defiance of the mandatory-binding rule, and a special "fields declared with a parameter type" clause propping up the canonical-form rules.

What the fix bought. A closed application — `!array { element_type: person }`, `!map { key_type: … }` — is now ordinary data of its constructor's vocabulary: the annotation head announces the shape (*this is a map*, not a record that happens to resemble one), the slot's value answers "of what", and [TSON-SCHEMA] §5.6's routing rule — a value routed by a parameter is application-supplied and appears in the binding record — becomes the *whole* story for type slots rather than a rule with a typed-field exception bolted on. Parameter classification sharpened in the same movement: the discriminator is what flows through the channel, so a route into a `type_ref`-typed field carries a reference and declares a type parameter, a route into a scalar field declares a value parameter, and `vector<T, S>` reads one of each straight off its own vocabulary. The carve-out this legitimises is correspondingly narrow: a parameterized head may annotate data exactly when all its parameters are `value_param` members ([TSON-SCHEMA] §7.2) — the array/map/set/vector family — while record templates like `container<T>`, whose parameter sits in a genuine type channel, remain uninstantiable in data, as they should.

One residual is deliberate. Source modifiers remain scalar tokens, so a slot can be pinned in source to a bare name (`element_type: type_ref = T`, or a concrete `= integer` in a partially-applied refinement template) but never to a compound application — compound references enter type slots only through substitution into binding records, where the field's own `type_ref` type carries them. The `record_field.value` channel therefore stays scalar-lexeme everywhere it occurs, which is what lets its declared type remain the kernel's `value` escape hatch under the documented dependent-type reading: the channel's real contract is "the field's declared type," and nothing that cannot be spelled as one token ever needs to inhabit it.

A second-order correction followed in review. The first resolved fixtures rendered the routed slots as `REQUIRED_FIXED` — a mechanical application of "`=` moves the field to its `_FIXED` state" — and the label was wrong for the same reason the original field typing was: it misread where the information lives. Nothing is fixed at declaration, because the value does not exist yet; a parametric `= P` *routes* the application's argument into the field, and since every application must bind every parameter, the field is simply REQUIRED — promoted there even from OPTIONAL, which is why `array_min`'s bound is mandatory in every closure. The binding record then supplies it the way data supplies any required field, which is what the closed forms had visibly been doing all along (`!map { key_type: …  value_type: … }` reads as required fields being provided, because that is what it is). The `~`/`=` distinction survives in the states themselves — REQUIRED_DEFAULT versus REQUIRED, each with a `value_param` member — and fixation reappears exactly where values become concrete: a refinement deriving from an application head receives the arguments as REQUIRED_FIXED bindings, so `map<text, integer> ^ { … }` can tighten the shape but never contradict the arguments that named it.


## 3. Lexical Design

### 3.1 The unquoted profile, derived

The unquoted-token profile is UAX #31's identifier profile plus exactly three characters — `-`, `+`, `.` — and the digit category `Nd`. Every addition is traceable to a production of the number grammar: `Nd` because scalar tokens, unlike identifiers, include numbers; `-` and `+` because they are the sign and exponent-sign characters; `.` because it is the decimal point and the leading character of `.inf`, `.infinity`, and `.nan`. Nothing is speculative, and all three extension characters are `Pattern_Syntax`, hence immutable across Unicode versions — the profile itself is frozen while its property-based components grow monotonically with new scripts. Their bare single-character forms, though, are not tokens: `-` alone is the subtraction operator, `..` is the range token, and bare `+` and `.` are lexer errors (§2.11).

The exclusions follow a single rule: a content kind the profile cannot cover *totally* is excluded *entirely*, so that its quoting rule is "always", never a per-character scan. Paths need `~`, `\`, and spaces; URIs need `:`; monetary amounts need currency symbols, grouping separators, and spaces; rationals and CIDR networks need `/`; percentages need `%`; ranges need `..`, which the lexer claims as the range token. Admitting any of these characters would let *some* paths or *some* URIs go unquoted — and a rule of the form "quote paths, except those without spaces, unless…" is precisely the cognitive load the profile exists to eliminate.

### 3.2 Quoting by kind

The payoff of the total-coverage rule is that quoting becomes a property of what a value *is*:

**Never quoted:** numbers, `null`/`true`/`false`, identifier- and enum-like names, `full-date` temporals (`2026-08-01`), UUIDs, hyphen-form MAC addresses, version strings.

**Always quoted:** anything containing whitespace or prose, timestamps and URIs (colons), email addresses (`@`), paths, rationals and CIDR networks (`/`), IPv6 addresses (colons), monetary amounts and percentages, ranges (`..`), the single-character strings `-`/`+`/`.`, and leading-underscore names.

A generator needs only two clauses: quote if any character falls outside the profile, and quote if the bare token would resolve to something other than the intended string (`"true"`, `"42"`, `"0x71C7…"`). A human writing TSON internalises the kind-level rule after a few documents and never thinks about individual characters again.

ZWNJ and ZWJ deserve their footnote: UAX #31 permits them in restricted contexts and some orthographies genuinely require them, but they are invisible, which makes them confusable and spoofing surface. Names that need them must be quoted — the profile trades a small orthographic inconvenience for the guarantee that two visually identical unquoted tokens are the same token.

### 3.3 Canonical identity: restrict, don't normalize

Reference identity ([TSON-DATA] §2.2.1) stays at RFC 3986's cheapest comparison rung — simple string comparison — by *restricting the input* rather than normalizing it. An identifying URI must already be lowercase-host, port-free, userinfo-free, dot-segment-free, fragment-free, with no percent-encoding of unreserved characters; anything else is an error, not a candidate for cleanup.

RFC 3986 §6.1 supplies the risk asymmetry that motivates the conservatism: for a schema system, a **false positive** — two distinct documents judged identical — validates data against the wrong contract, silently; a **false negative** merely costs a redundant registration or fetch. Every rung of normalization ladder an implementation climbs (case folding, path resolution, percent-decoding, scheme-specific rules) buys convenience by increasing false-positive risk and by widening the room for two implementations to disagree about identity. TSON climbs one deliberate rung — the scheme is dropped, so `http`/`https` variance names the same document — because transport choice demonstrably should not fork a document's identity, and stops there. The host, by contrast, is load-bearing on purpose: a fetch-endpoint change cannot silently redirect a name.

### 3.4 Content addressing and the verification chain

The hash-parameter convention (`?sha256=…`, verification metadata rather than identity) composes into a Merkle-style dependency graph in the manner of content-addressed stores: a data document pins its schema, the schema pins its meta-schema and imports, and the chain grounds in the pre-loaded bootstrap. A consumer holding a single hashed reference can therefore verify a document *together with its entire contract chain* — every byte that determines how the document will be interpreted — without trusting any intermediary. The rule that the hash input is every byte after the `!!id` line exists to make this work: a document can carry its own name without the name's spelling perturbing its hash, so registrars and mirrors can relocate content while the identity-plus-hash pair stays verifiable.

**Mixed references combine per identity.** In practice, references to one schema will arrive in mixed spellings — one document pins, another does not — and the resolution model is built for that. Within a closure, verification attaches to the canonical identity, not to individual references (the closure already loads one instance per identity, so there is nothing else it *could* attach to): the digests declared across all references to an identity form a set, and an empty set resolves unverified, a single digest verifies the content once — at collection, before any reference resolves — and two distinct digests are a conflict reported as an error, never chosen between. A plain reference in a closure that also pins the identity therefore rides the pin: it resolves to the verified instance, and if verification fails, it fails too — leniency in what authors may write, never a fallback to unverified content. The practical consequence is that pinning is additive rather than viral: any one document in a closure can raise an identity's guarantee for the whole resolution, and no published plain reference can lower it. (§2.13 records the stricter rule this replaced, and why it could not survive contact with publication.)

**The one edge that cannot be pinned.** The kernel's `!!meta` references its own URL, and that reference can never carry a hash: the hash input includes the `!!meta` line, so the pin would have to hash bytes containing itself. This is not a defect to route around but the place where the verification chain hands over to the bootstrap — the self-reference is grounded by pre-loading (§1.3), and the mixed-reference rule is what lets every *other* reference to the kernel be pinned while the kernel's own stays plain. The kernel's `!!id` line, being excluded from the hash input, *can* carry the kernel's published digest — a useful registration cross-check, verified at registration per [TSON-SCHEMA] §10.2 — but an embedded hash authenticates nothing by itself: an attacker who can rewrite the body can rewrite the id line to match. Trust always flows from the referencing side or from the pre-load; the embedded digest is a convenience for registrars, not a root.

**Publication discipline: pin everything pinnable.** The mixed-reference rule makes plain references legal everywhere; the published artifacts nonetheless ship maximally pinned, because the Merkle guarantee holds only along edges that are actually pinned — a consumer holding a pinned reference to core has verified meta *through* core only if core's own `!!meta` carries meta's digest. The artifact hashes are computed bottom-up, each stage's pins in place before the next stage hashes over them: the kernel's body first (its self-referencing `!!meta` plain, its `!!id` carrying the resulting digest), then meta with its kernel references pinned, then core with its meta reference pinned. Publishers of type libraries should follow the same discipline: pin `!!meta` and every `!!import` at publication, so that one hashed reference to the library verifies its entire chain.

The specifications stop at verification deliberately. Ordering, consensus, and mutability policy — everything a content-addressed *store* adds on top — are application concerns; TSON supplies the identity discipline they need and nothing more.


## 4. The Schema Ladder, Narratively

### 4.1 What schema-value separation buys

The fundamental rule — a document never resolves type annotations against its own definitions — looks austere until you list what it purchases:

- **Stable meaning.** `!text` in a document means what the referenced schema says, full stop. Two documents referencing the same schema have identical vocabularies; no document can locally shadow a type and change the meaning of data that quotes it.
- **Reviewability.** A schema is a self-contained published artifact. Reviewing a data document requires its schema and nothing else; reviewing a schema requires its meta and imports and nothing else. There is no "definitions section" whose scope leaks into the data.
- **Immutability with teeth.** Because schemas are external, hash-pinnable artifacts, "the contract cannot change under you" is a verifiable property rather than a convention.
- **Uniformity all the way up.** The same rule governs data documents, user schemas, and the meta layer itself, so the resolver has one resolution model rather than a special case per layer.

### 4.2 Why one hop

All resolution against a governing target is one hop: the target's namespace — locals plus imports — is consulted directly, and no further rung of the ladder is walked. The alternative (walking the chain until a name resolves) is how most inheritance systems work, and its failure mode is well known: the effective vocabulary of a document becomes the union of everything above it, so adding a name anywhere up the chain can change the meaning of documents that never mention that rung. One-hop resolution makes every document's vocabulary *finite, explicit, and owned by exactly one schema*. The cost is the "import what you expose" obligation — a meta-schema must import every schema whose entries it intends to offer — and the specification chooses to pay it, because the obligation falls on the few authors of meta-schemas rather than the many authors of documents.

### 4.3 Import what you expose, worked

`meta.tn1` is the worked example. Meta's own declarations use kernel types (`token`, `type_name`, `value`), so it needs the kernel import for itself. But the import does double duty: because every meta-governed schema resolves constructor roles against *meta's namespace, one hop*, the kernel import is also the delivery mechanism that places `enum`, `record`, `array`, the sugar-form desugar targets, and `type_definition` in front of every user schema and every resolver-output document. Delete the import and meta's own body still nearly works — but every schema chaining to meta loses the structural vocabulary, and resolver output can no longer name its own body types. The one-hop rule turns a meta-schema's import list into its published API surface, which is exactly the property you want reviewable.

### 4.4 Where annotations live, and why it feels asymmetric

Annotations resolve one hop against the governing target — the `!!meta` target for a schema document, the `!!schema` target for a data document. The asymmetry that surprises authors: an annotation type declared in a user schema is usable in that schema's *data documents* but not in the schema document itself, whose governing target is meta. This is the one-hop rule being consistent rather than an exception to it: the schema document is governed by meta, so its metadata vocabulary is meta's business; its data documents are governed by the schema, so their metadata vocabulary is the schema's business. Custom annotations for schema documents therefore require an extended meta-schema — a heavier act, deliberately, because schema-document metadata is tooling-facing and benefits from ecosystem-wide agreement.


## 5. A Tour of the Type Operations

The type system's operations form a spectrum of completeness — each operation takes a definition some distance further toward concrete data.

**Construction** (`!C { bindings }` in the schema grammar) creates a new type from a constructor. It is the origin point of every atom family and every structural type, and it transfers *kind*, never IS-A: `dogs => !integer_type {}` founds a fresh atom family with the same constraint vocabulary as `integer` and no relation to it. Construction creating siblings rather than subtypes is the load-bearing choice — it is what lets one constructor found unrelated nominal families (`integer` and `dogs` do not accidentally unify), and it is why the atom family's IS-A facts live in `supertypes` rather than being derivable from bodies.

**Refinement** (`T ^ { ... }` or `!I ^ { values }`) copies a definition and tightens it — binding values, fixing defaults, restricting ranges — while preserving IS-A with the source. Refinement never adds fields; the transition table in [TSON-SCHEMA] §5.7 is monotone toward FIXED, and FIXED is terminal. A chain of refinements is a chain of promises, each stronger than the last, and any consumer expecting the source type can accept the refined one.

**Composition** (`A & B & { ... }`) is construction with declared ancestry: new fields are permitted, each listed supertype contributes IS-A, and the disjointness rule (no field name from two supertype paths) keeps the merge order-independent and diamond-free. The IS-A is cashed out at the data level by subsumption ([TSON-SCHEMA] §7.2): `!employee` is valid at a `person`-typed field, and validates in full as an employee — closure, constraints, and defaults are the subtype's — while an unannotated value at that field is exactly a `person`, so the annotation is the sole carrier of the more specific type. That is the point of composition in an application schema: a field typed by a parent admits the whole family the schema declares beneath it, each member naming itself on the wire when it appears. Subtraction stays outside the family by construction — the check reads `type_definition.supertypes`, the contract, never the body's lineage (§2.5) — and choice discrimination is the same surface gesture under a different membership relation: an annotation selecting a more specific type than the position promises, variant-of for choices, IS-A here.

**Subtraction** (`head - { fields }`) removes fields and breaks IS-A — see §2.5 above for why this is a feature, and §2.10 for why the clause sits at the head.

**Instantiation** is the data-level end of the spectrum: `!T value` in a data document produces a concrete value, terminal by definition. There is no construction in data; the same surface shape (`!C { bindings }`) in a data document is a record that *describes* constraints — which is precisely what resolver output stores.

The one-way flow — construct, refine, instantiate, stop — is what makes the resolver's job tractable: every definition has a finite derivation ending at a constructor, every body desugars to one canonical form, and the data level never feeds back into the type level.


## 6. Atoms in Depth

### 6.1 The three unit atoms

**`value`** is the escape hatch: it admits whatever base type resolution produces (null, boolean, integer, float, string), which makes it the type of "a scalar the schema language cannot or will not constrain". Its principal legitimate uses are the kernel's own bootstrap (constraint fields whose natural type does not exist yet at kernel-load time — see §6.2) and genuinely dynamic data. Reaching for `value` in an application schema is usually a design smell; reaching for it in a meta-schema is sometimes forced.

**`token`** is the identifier primitive: NFC-canonical, whitespace-free, equal iff byte-identical in canonical form. It shares its host representation with `text` but not its contract — a `token` can always be rendered back as an unquoted lexeme, which is why the kernel uses it for `type_name`, `field_name`, `param_name`, and enum members. The NFC requirement does no work at parse time for unquoted lexemes (the lexer already rejects non-NFC source) and normalises quoted lexemes at identifier positions, so "same identifier" can never depend on Unicode composition happenstance.

**`void`** is the unit type of absence: one inhabitant, the absent sentinel `_`. Its two jobs are being the target type of bare annotations (`@deprecated` is sugar for `@deprecated:_` — presence is the information) and expressing "no value" as a field type or choice variant. The `null`-at-`void` concession (the token `null` accepted as an equivalent spelling and normalised to `_`) exists for JSON-shaped data under a schema; it is safe precisely because `void` has a single inhabitant, so no absence-vs-value distinction can be lost there — and it is confined to `void` so the distinction stays sharp everywhere else.

### 6.2 Constraint fields typed as `value`

`decimal_type.min` cannot be typed `number`, because `number` is a *core* instance of `decimal_type` — the constraint field exists before the type that would naturally fill it. This bootstrap ordering is why several atom constructors type their bounds as `value?`. The kernel's `integer_type` is the exception that proves the rule: its bounds are typed `integer` because `integer` lives in the kernel's own namespace.

The consequence for implementers is the eager-conversion rule: each constrained atom converts `value`-typed constraint values to its internal representation at schema-load time, never per-validation. The rule sounds like an optimisation but is really a correctness property — a schema either loads cleanly or fails with a clear diagnostic, and there is no such thing as a half-valid schema that parses but mis-validates on the millionth record. Which host types an implementation accepts for conversion (may an integer token bound a decimal field?) is an implementation choice; the validation semantics *after* conversion are the atom's contract, so two implementations that both load a schema agree on what it validates.

### 6.3 Exact and approximate numeric tiers

The numeric vocabulary is split into an exact tier (`number`, `rational`, the fixed-width integers) and an approximate tier (`float32`, `float64`), and the split is annotated in the type library with `@exact`. The design intent: a bare JSON-ish number carries no width or precision commitment, so it maps to `number` — preserved as written — and lossiness enters only when a consumer *chooses* an approximate type, at which point rounding onto the IEEE 754 grid is that type's documented contract rather than a surprise. The special values (`.inf`, `.nan`, signed zeros) belong to the approximate tier only, and NaN payloads are deliberately not information: every NaN denotes the canonical quiet NaN, so value preservation holds by definition and payload-dependent round-trip bugs are excluded by fiat.


## 7. A Complete Worked Example

The task-tracking schema from [TSON-SCHEMA] §1.6, taken all the way through resolution. The schema document:

```
!!id:"https://example.com/task.tn1"
!!meta:"https://tson.io/2026/32/m/meta.tn1"
!!import:"https://tson.io/2026/32/m/core.tn1"
@doc:"Task-tracking example schema."
{
  priority => !integer ^ { min: 1  max: 5 }
  status   => !enum [OPEN ACTIVE DONE]
  flagged  => <T, N> { entry: T  priority: priority ~ N }
  task => {
    id:       uuid
    title:    non_empty_text
    priority: priority ~ 3
    status:   status ~ OPEN
    due:      date?
    tags:     [text]?
    history:  [flagged<status, 2>]?
  }
}
```

`priority` refines core's `integer` instance; `status` applies the `enum` constructor, reached through the structure namespace supplied by the `!!meta` target; `task` is a fresh record whose field types resolve through the type-name namespace — `uuid`, `non_empty_text`, and `date` from the core import, `priority` and `status` from the local declarations. The `~` modifiers place `priority` and `status` in the REQUIRED_DEFAULT state; `[text]?` is an OPTIONAL field whose inline array type is carried structurally — a `type_ref` value at the field, no entry materialised ([TSON-SCHEMA] §5.3, §8.1). `flagged` is a template with a type parameter and a value parameter — a fresh record whose `priority` field is defaulted by parameter (`~ N`), built entirely from the schema's own names, since kernel constructors like `array` are not nameable at derivation positions in an ordinary schema ([TSON-SCHEMA] §3.3.2, §5.3) — and `[flagged<status, 2>]?` wraps its fully-bound application in the array sugar ([TSON-SCHEMA] §5.10).

A data document binds the schema and instantiates:

```
!!schema:"https://example.com/task.tn1"
!task {
  id:       550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
  title:    "Ship revision 32"
  priority: 3
  status:   OPEN
  due:      2026-08-01
  tags:     [spec editorial]
  history:  [{ entry: OPEN }  { entry: ACTIVE  priority: 4 }]
}
```

Note that `priority` and `status` restate their default values: a document that states its defaults reads without its schema, and omitting a defaulted field is an encoder optimisation — lossless only because the decoder injects the value back on read.

Resolution derives a schema value, serialized as resolver output — a data document governed by the meta-schema, in which every declaration has desugared to the canonical `!C { bindings }` form and fields at their default values are omitted (`constructor: false`, `state: REQUIRED`):

```
!!schema:"https://tson.io/2026/32/m/meta.tn1"
!schema {
  priority => !type_definition {
    kind: ATOM
    source: integer_type
    supertypes: [integer]
    body: !integer_type { min: 1  max: 5 }
  }
  status => !type_definition {
    kind: ATOM
    source: enum
    body: !enum { members: [OPEN ACTIVE DONE] }
  }
  flagged => !type_definition {
    kind: PRODUCT
    parameters: [T N]
    body: !record { fields: [
      !record_field { name: entry     type: T }
      !record_field { name: priority  type: priority  state: REQUIRED_DEFAULT  value_param: N }
    ] }
  }
  task => !type_definition {
    kind: PRODUCT
    body: !record { fields: [
      !record_field { name: id        type: uuid }
      !record_field { name: title     type: non_empty_text }
      !record_field { name: priority  type: priority  state: REQUIRED_DEFAULT  value: 3 }
      !record_field { name: status    type: status    state: REQUIRED_DEFAULT  value: OPEN }
      !record_field { name: due       type: date      state: OPTIONAL }
      !record_field { name: tags      type: { name: array  arguments: [ { name: text } ] }  state: OPTIONAL }
      !record_field { name: history   type: { name: array  arguments: [ { name: flagged_status_4c1 } ] }  state: OPTIONAL }
    ] }
  }
  flagged_status_4c1 => !type_definition {
    kind: PRODUCT
    source: { name: flagged  arguments: [ { name: status }  { value: 2 } ] }
    body: !record { fields: [
      !record_field { name: entry     type: status }
      !record_field { name: priority  type: priority  state: REQUIRED_DEFAULT  value: 2 }
    ] }
  }
}
```

Reading the output:

- `priority` shows **refinement**: the surface form `!integer ^ { ... }` retargeted to the instance's source constructor (`source: integer_type`), with IS-A recorded against the refined instance (`supertypes: [integer]`). This is the case where `supertypes` carries information the body cannot: compare a hypothetical sibling `port => !integer_type { min: 0  max: 65535 }`, which would serialize with the *same* `source` and an identical body shape but empty `supertypes`.
- `status` shows **construction**: the `enum` constructor's ATOM kind is inherited, `source: enum` is recorded, and `supertypes` stays empty — construction transfers kind, not IS-A. The positional sugar `!enum [OPEN ACTIVE DONE]` has desugared to the explicit binding `{ members: [...] }`.
- `task` shows the **field-state machinery**: each `record_field` carries its state (the default REQUIRED omitted) and the eagerly-resolved default values, so consumers read defaults from the output without re-parsing modifier tokens.
- `tags` shows **structural carriage**: the inline `[text]` is a constructor application, represented in place as a `type_ref` — `{ name: array  arguments: [ { name: text } ] }` — and interpreted directly against `array`'s vocabulary. No entry is materialised for it.
- `flagged` and `flagged_status_4c1` show the **template machinery** end to end. The open template's body stays at the level where parameter channels exist: `T` rides `entry`'s type channel by shadowing, and the default `~ N` is the labelled `value_param` member at REQUIRED_DEFAULT ([TSON-SCHEMA] §5.7). The instantiation is the closed form: substitution swaps `type: T` for `type: status` and `value_param: N` for `value: 2`, and the fully-bound application recorded in `source` makes the entry self-describing — its body is recomputable by substitution. `history`'s field type then wraps the entry name in a structural array — instantiation and structural carriage composing. The entry's name is internal — `flagged_status_4c1` is this resolver's choice, not the specification's; identity is structural equality of `source`, and another implementation may name the same entry differently. For the constructor-collapse case (a refinement template closing to a `!array` binding record with inherited supertypes), see [TSON-SCHEMA] §8.2's `array_ranged` example.


## 8. Resolver Output for Consumers

### 8.1 Why instantiation identity is structural — and names are internal

Earlier revisions took the opposite position this section once defended: inline forms and template applications materialised *synthetic entries* named by the canonical rendering of the source expression, and identity was deliberately textual — two forms denoted the same entry iff their renderings were identical strings. Textual identity was cheap and decidable, but it made the rendering algorithm itself a conformance surface (every implementation had to produce byte-identical names, so the specification legislated whitespace stripping, bound canonicalisation, and ordering rules), and it forked identity on spelling: `[id]` and `[uuid]` named different entries for one shape, and a template body like `[tree<T>]` put a parameter binder inside a string — a name that could never safely be compared, substituted into, or verified.

The structured type-reference model dissolved both problems at once, and the current design is the endpoint of following it through. Constructor applications stopped materialising entries at all — a field typed `[text]` carries the application structurally, and a validator interprets it against `array`'s vocabulary in one hop, so nothing needs a name. Template instantiations still materialise (recursion, dedup, and reference targets need entries), but their identity became **structural equality of the flattened, fully-bound application** — precisely the relation textual identity was approximating, minus the string. And once identity is structural, the entry's *name* carries no information: it is a resolver-internal key, chosen freely (a readable head plus a structural hash is the recommended style), fresh against declared names by construction, and explicitly outside the conformance surface. The entry stays self-describing through `source`, which records the flattened application — so ingest verifies an instantiation by recomputing its body from its `source`, not by parsing its name.

What the demotion bought: the rendering grammar left the specification entirely; spelling variance can no longer fork entries; two conforming resolvers may disagree on every internal name and still agree structurally; and value arguments needed no "renderable value" fence, since nothing about a name constrains what an application may contain. What it cost: resolved output for template-using schemas is no longer byte-identical across implementations — conformance comparison there is structural, equality up to renaming of instantiation entries. The shipped artifacts sidestep even that: kernel, meta, and core apply no non-constructor templates, so their fixtures contain no instantiation entries at all.

**Where the materialisation line sits.** With names internal, one could ask why the line stays where it is — why `flagged<status, 2>` earns an entry while the `array` wrapping it stays a structural `type_ref`, when a uniform rule in either direction would also be representable. The answer is what a consumer must *do* to interpret each. A constructor application is a **positional fill**: the arguments map one-to-one onto declared slots, meaning is complete in hand, interpretation is a one-hop vocabulary lookup — derived *and local*, so by the storage rule (§2.7's cousin in [TSON-SCHEMA] §8.1) it compiles at load and is never stored. A template application is a **substitution**: knowing what it means requires copying the template's body and rewriting its parameter channels — the resolver's hardest algorithm, whose output is *derived but non-local* (it needs the template's declaration plus the arguments), so it is stored once, exactly as `subtypes` is. The forcing case is recursion: `tree<text>`'s fully structural form is infinite — its children's element type is itself — and a tree-shaped document cannot express that cycle without a name; the entry is the knot. So an application has three spellings, each confined to the one place it is forced: structural inside open bodies (substitution cannot yet run), an entry name at closed use sites (substitution has run), and an entry where substitution *produced new content*. The line coincides exactly with `~` — the entry-weight dial (§2.12): a `~` head says applications bind against a vocabulary; its absence says applications finish a suspended declaration, and the entry marks the finishing.

### 8.2 The two supertypes fields, once more

Consumers should internalise the split: `type_definition.supertypes` is the **contract** (transitive IS-A — use it for "can a value of X go where Y is expected"); the body's `record.supertypes` is the **lineage** (direct `&` compositions as written — use it to reconstruct or display source-level structure). Subtraction is the case that forces the distinction (lineage without contract), and the atom family is the case that makes `type_definition.supertypes` primary data rather than a cache (refinement vs sibling construction serialize identically except for this field). `subtypes`, by contrast, is always a recomputable cache and never trusted on ingest.

### 8.3 Error messages

The specification's error categories are minimal by design; implementations compete on diagnostics. Some conventions that have worked well: report *parse* failures ("`twelve` is not an integer") separately from *validation* failures ("300 exceeds age's max of 150") since users fix them differently; never surface internal instantiation names as the primary form (show the source application, recovered from the entry's `source`, the originating position, and `@alias` — the user wrote `[text; 1..]`; show them `[text; 1..]` or `array_min<text, 1>`); and on unresolved-type errors under a schema, say *which namespace was searched* — "no `uuid` in schema X (did you mean to import core?)" turns the most common beginner error into a one-line fix.


## 9. Deployment and Encoding Guidance

### 9.1 Versioning: publish, don't mutate

Most schema systems version by *mutating a shared definition* and policing the mutation with compatibility rules. TSON versions by *publishing*: a schema's identity is its exact byte content, so version N and version N+1 are independent, immutable artifacts with different hashes and different identities ([TSON-SCHEMA] §3.5). Nothing evolves in place. A data document locks to the one contract it was written against — the hash-pinned `!!schema` on its opening lines — and that binding never drifts, because neither side can change.

Acceptance then becomes explicit, and it lives where it belongs: at the boundary. A server's code binds to the *set* of schema versions it accepts, registering each in its schema library, and every request is validated against exactly the contract the request names. Because the version key sits in the header, dispatch is cheap: document kind and schema identity are readable from the opening bytes, before any value parsing ([TSON-DATA] §2.2, §7.1).

For major upgrades there is a stronger pattern than binding one server to every version: run version-specific servers and **route on the schema reference**. A front door reads `!!schema`, matches canonical identity and hash, and dispatches; each server behind it holds exactly one contract at full strength, and retiring a version is deleting a route. This is the architecture the industry converged on from the other direction — Stripe's date-versioned API with server-side translation between pinned versions is the best-documented example ([Stripe, *APIs as infinite versions*](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning)) — but there the version key is a bespoke HTTP header; here it is a first-class, verifiable property of the document itself.

What this retires is the compatibility rulebook — the folklore every mutable-schema system accumulated because one definition had to serve every point in time:

- **Protocol Buffers.** `required` is marked *"Do not use"* in the [proto2 language guide](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto2/), the maxim being "required is forever"; Buf documents it as the root cause of early Google outages ([Tip of the Week #8: never use required](https://buf.build/blog/totw-8-never-use-required)). The [*Updating A Message Type*](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto2/#updating) rules add the rest of the liturgy: never change a field number, never reuse one, mark removals `reserved`, add only optional or repeated fields. Proto3 went further — deleted `required` outright and made every field optional with zero-value defaults — then spent years restoring the [field presence](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/field_presence/) that deletion had cost.
- **Avro.** Reader and writer schemas are reconciled pairwise under the specification's [Schema Resolution](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/) rules — new fields must carry defaults, renames need aliases — and an entire product category, the schema registry, exists to police mutation with [BACKWARD / FORWARD / FULL and transitive compatibility modes](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/fundamentals/schema-evolution.html).
- **GraphQL.** The official best practice is a versionless API under ["continuous evolution"](https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/#versioning): never remove, only `@deprecated`.
- **Beneath them all,** Postel's robustness principle — *"be liberal in what you accept"* (RFC 761) — which the IAB has since formally walked back as a long-term hazard to protocol health (RFC 9413, *Maintaining Robust Protocols*).

Every rule on that list is the same trade: weaken the contract so the timeline stays compatible. Fields end up optional forever, unknown fields must be tolerated, removal is forbidden — and the guarantees the schema no longer makes migrate into application code as defensive checks, validation pushed from a place where it is declared once to a place where it must be reimplemented everywhere. (Part 8 of the proto-schema research traces this history in detail.)

TSON's model dissolves the dilemma rather than picking a side. Records are closed under their type ([TSON-SCHEMA] §7.2) and required means required — *per version*. A field can be required in version 12 and gone in version 13, because 12 and 13 are different artifacts and no rule forces one definition to satisfy both. Compatibility between two versions becomes something tooling can **check** — resolver output is data, so two versions diff structurally — and a policy a team may **choose** at a given boundary, never a constraint the schema language imposes on every author to keep a mutable timeline coherent.

### 9.2 Schema libraries in practice

The library model (lookup, never fetch-by-default) maps onto deployments straightforwardly: production systems register every schema at startup — from files, embedded resources, or an internal registry — and disable runtime fetching entirely; development setups may enable fetching with an allowlist and treat it as a cache-population convenience. Registering under an application-supplied identity (for `!!id`-less development schemas) is handy in tests but should never survive into interchange: publish with `!!id`, pin with hashes at trust boundaries.

**Chain-wide strictness is a resolver policy.** The mixed-reference rule (§3.4) deliberately leaves "every identity in my closure is verified" out of the format; deployments that want it enforce it at the boundary. Two mechanisms cover the need: a *require-pinned* resolver mode, which fails resolution when any identity's digest set is empty (pre-loaded entries excepted, or checked as below); and a resolution report listing which identities resolved unpinned, for audits that prefer visibility to refusal. Together they recover everything the deleted all-or-nothing coherence rule (§2.13) was reaching for, as a choice made where trust boundaries are actually known — per deployment — rather than a constraint on every author in every closure.

**Ship digests with pre-loaded schemas.** A pinned reference to a pre-loaded identity (`!!meta:"…meta.tn1?sha256=…"`) must be checkable, but the pre-loaded model is an in-memory structure, not bytes. Implementations should therefore ship, alongside each pre-loaded schema, its published canonical digest (or the canonical document bytes), and compare declared pins against it — a mismatch is the ordinary verification error, not an unverifiable assertion. Without this, pins to the meta layer degrade into decoration exactly where the chain is supposed to ground.

### 9.3 Defaults on the wire

Encoders should write values for defaulted fields. A document that states its defaults reads without its schema — `priority: 3` means 3 to every reader, schema in hand or not — whereas omission makes the document's meaning schema-relative. Omitting fields at their default values is a legitimate wire-size optimisation precisely because the decoder injects the value back on read, but it should be an explicit encoder option, not the default posture. Resolver output is the sanctioned exception: it omits fields at defaults because its consumers are, by definition, schema-aware, and the compression materially improves fixture readability.

### 9.4 Directive-per-line

Scoped `!!schema` directives on array elements read best one element per line, directive first — the layout in [TSON-SCHEMA] §7.8's example. The grammar does not require it, but the convention keeps the scope-opening directive visually attached to the single element it governs, which matters in review: scope changes are the highest-consequence lines in a document.
